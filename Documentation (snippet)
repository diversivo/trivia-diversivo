DIVERSIVO TRIVIA - DOCUMENTATION FOR DEVELOPERS
===============================================
(by aerojas - v1.0 Nov.19,2018)


1. What is this
===============
Diversivo trivia is a simple game where the user is shown a set of cards, initially showing just an image. The user
can click a card, making the card flip, showing a question. The user tries to answer the question shown in the card,
then clicks the card again, making it flip, and showing the answer.

2. How it works
===============

3. The menu 
===============
The menu element is the first element shown to the user. It includes very few options, like 'Play' and 'About'. The
'Play' option launches the game screen, while the 'About' option shows an informational pop-up containing the
name of the game, the authors and other interesting stuff, like links.

4. The game
===============
When the user clicks 'Play' on the menu, the page hides the menu and shows the game. This trivia game consists
in a set of cards, which are clickable, disposed in a grid. Each card contains a question and its respective
answer, read from a JSON file. The user can click each card to show the question, try to answer, and then click
again to show the answer. The cards can be clicked in no particular order.

There is no countdown when playing the game, so the user can take all the time he/she wants to play it.

The game screen should provide a way to the user to end the game, whenever he/she has completed the game or not. In
both cases, the termination of the game should return the user to the menu.

5. Points vs no points mode
==========================
The default mode is no points mode. In this mode, the cards only show their question and answer when clicked, with
no reward to the user if he/she answers correctly.

The other (planned) mode is Points mode. In this mode, when the user clicks the card and its question is shown, the
user is also presented with a set of possible answers. If the correct answer is selected, a number of points are added
to the user's score. If the incorrect answer is selected, no points are added (or substracted).

6. The card element
===================
A card is a single rectangular element on the game screen which contains a question and its answer. It's clickable and
should show an animation when clicked, like flipping the card. A card has three states: covered, showing the question,
and showing the answer.

- Covered: the initial state of the card. It just shows an image, like a logo, resembling a cards' back, where the
relevant content is hidden.

- Showing the question: the state after a Covered card is clicked on. It shows a white background with text in the center;
the text is the question that the user must answer. If Points mode is implemented and enabled, the points the card is worth
are shown as a number within a circle in the upper right corner of the card. Also, when Points mode is enabled, a little
menu with three options is shown next to the card. The user must click one of the available choices in order to answer the
question, making the card flip again, show the answer and add the points if needed. If No Points mode is enabled, the user
just needs to click the card directly to show the answer.

- Showing the answer: the final state of the card. It shows a white background with text in the center. Optionally, if Poitents
mode is enabled, the card/text combo can show different colors depending if the user answered correctly or not. When a card
in this state is clicked, it does nothing. The answer is kept shown until the user restarts the game.

7. The questions file
=====================

The questions file is a JSON formatted text file which contains an array of Question objects. Each Question object contains
four elements:

- Question: The question text
- Answer: The answer text
- Options: If Points mode is enabled, an array of possible choices to answer the question. One of the choices should be identical
to the value of Answer.
- Points: How many points are awarded to the user if answered the question correctly.
